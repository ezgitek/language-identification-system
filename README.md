# Language Identification System

We implemented a language identification system in Python using Discriminating between Similar Languages (DSL) Shared Task 2015 corpus. he analysis is based on character unigrams, meaning that the identification of a language is based on letter frequencies. The hypothesis is that each language either has unique characters or use the characters with unique probabilities.
In our corpus, there are 13 languages, each with 2000 sentences, so our cor- pus has a balanced distribution with 26000 sentences in total. The languages in question are Bulgarian, Bosnian, Czech, Argentine Spanish, Peninsular Spanish, Croatian, Indonesian, Macedonian, Malay, Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, Slovak and Serbian.

We mainly tried two models to solve this problem: Generative Modeling (Naive Bayes) and Discriminative Modeling (SVM). We used Cornellâ€™s SVM multiclass library. 

We evaluated the approaches used above with accuracy, recall, precision, F-measure.

## Program Execution

The program can be run in three modes: naive Bayes, unigram SVM and super SVM. Note that the program will not run without the mode argument.

In order to run the program in naive bayes mode, go to the directory of the python file and type:
> python identifier.py naive\_bayes

In order to run the program in SVM modes, path to the svm-multiclass
directory must also be given as an argument. 

For unigram SVM mode, type:
> python identifier.py unigram\_svm path/to/svm-multiclass 

For super SVM mode, type:
> python identifier.py super\_svm path/to/svm-multiclass
